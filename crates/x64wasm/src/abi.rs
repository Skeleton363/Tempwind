//! The ABI between translated modules and their hosts. See `docs/design/abi.md`.
//!
//! A translated module imports `env.memory` (memory64) and exports
//! `run(state: i64) -> i32`. Guest virtual addresses equal offsets in that
//! memory. `state` is the guest address of a [`STATE_SIZE`]-byte CPU state
//! block laid out as below.
